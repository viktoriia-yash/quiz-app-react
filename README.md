# Quiz App
Since my coding learning is too slow (I took too much everything), I arranged a personal coding marathon for a whole week. The main goal - do one project per day from 28.06.2023 to 04.07.2023.
<br />
This is my seventh and final project in this marathon - Quiz App. To create it, I used React and Open Trivia Database API. Also, there was Material UI, but I remained dissatisfied with the results. I think it's very challenging and isn't worth the effort ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<br />
<br />
I had to finish this marathon on 04.07, but unfortunately, I got sick and managed to finish it only today, on 07.07. But in the end, I'm rather pleased with the results of this marathon. Even though there weren't any criteria for it, I feel that I have become more confident about React and API.
